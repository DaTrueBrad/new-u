# MVP
## Description
New U is a mobile application workout tracker. THis is a redo of my student capstone, redone not only with my extra year or knowledge, but in react native, somethng entirely new. This will be my first full-stack react native project.

The server portion of this project is private, as it contains secrets and methods that would reveal the backend structure of the app. For security, I cannot make it public.
